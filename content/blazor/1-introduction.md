## What is Blazor

Blazor is Microsoft's solution for the single page web application developoment frameworks e.g. React, Vue, Angular etc. 

## Why you should even think of adopting Blazor?

If you want to do web client side development in C#, then Blazor is an ideal solution. You don't need to learn JavaScript.

It is not that simple. It actually goes way beyond JavaScript. Blazor is an SPA framework for web development. It is an alternate of libraries like React, Vue and the likes.

If you have experience in React, you know that it is not just about React and JavaScript. You need to learn

- Formik for Form handling
- Axios for sending http requests to API
- Yup for form validation
- ChakraUI for layouts, UI controls
- react-select for search textbox
- react-dropzone for file upload drag and drop
- react-router-dom for routing
- grid like component that can do searching, paging and sorting
- TypeScript if you want to see type safety errors at compile time

The list may go on and on. There are a lot of good libraries for each of the above requirement. Almost all are open source, with tons of users and support. It is really great and fun to work on all these, but it takes time to learn.

If you have past experience of development in ASP.NET Forms and MVC, and you want to do client side web in 2024, then you can try Blazor. It is quick, it is Microsoft, means most of the features are built in.
